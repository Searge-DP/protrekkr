The tracker can be quite CPU intensive<br>
(especially when the CPU have to handle visuals as well but nowadays most of that<br>
is done on GPUs), a 1.5ghz processor may be the bare minimum<br>
when replaying heavy modules (16 tracks all effects/polyphony on).<br>

The only computer running under Mac OS X i have is a dual 450Mhz G4<br>
and it doesn't make at all and there's a lot of hiccups<br>
(although the system monitor doesn't show more than 60% usage for both CPU<br>
so i may have made a mistake somewhere).<br>
