Go to the install directory, right click on the "LameACM.inf" file and selected "install".<br>
Do the same for the "atrac3.inf" file, this will install both codecs in the system.<br>
<br>
Without these 2 codecs installed, ptk wouldn't be able to pack samples<br>
in Mp3 or Atrac3 (only used on PSP) formats.<br>
