In order to keep a constant layout for the keyboard, the tracker uses locale
keyboards text definitions which are located within the skins directory.

These files contains the full name of the region on the first line
and the 37 ASCII codes used for that particular type of keyboard
(the keys layout) following on 4 rows.

To add a new keyboard definition:

first copy an already existing file and rename it after the keyboard's country
it is supposed to describe, modify the 4 rows then edit the skin.xml file
and insert it's file's name into the value key of the "keyboards" tag
along with the others.

Load (or reload) the tracker and select the new keyboard
in the Misc. Setup panel.

Hexadecimal notation is allowed in the form 0xXXXX or just plain ASCII.
(it *may* work with unicode characters but i haven't tested it).

You can eventually submit a new keyboard layout at: hitchhikr@australia.edu
