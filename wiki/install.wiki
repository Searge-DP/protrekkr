 Simply copy the files lame_acm.xml & lameACM.acm located in the install
directory into the system directory of the OS (usually Windows/system32).

 The particular version of the lame mp3 encoder will strip some datas off
compared to the official one (thus producing slightly smaller files).

 Please note that this manipulation will only save a small amount of bytes
so it may not be necessary.
