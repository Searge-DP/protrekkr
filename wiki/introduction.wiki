[http://code.google.com/p/protrekkr/ ProTrekkr]
(formerly known as NoiseTrekker by Juan Antonio Arguelles Rius aka Arguru)
is a tracker program combining a software synthesizer together with
a traditional samples tracker which can (mainly) be used to create
electronic music (like psytrance, IDM, chip, techno, etc.)
for small sized intros, demos or games.

 The tracker is available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

- Patterns based tracker style sequencer.
- Synthesizer with custom waveforms support.
- 2 303s units.
- Cubic spline interpolation.
- Wav files import/export.
- 16 or 32 bits wav rendering
- Multi effects engine with reverb, distortion, filters, delay, EQs, flanger, etc...
- Midi in/out support.
- Protracker .mod files import.
- Samples compressor handling Gsm/Mp3/TrueSpeech (not on Linux/Mac OS X yet).
- Replay routine source code to be included & used inside your own programs
  (Also featuring a replay routine for the PlayStation Portable).

 This is a FREEWARE tool, this means that you can use it for whatever
you want and for free. There's NO GUARANTEE that this program will perform
well or even run on your computer.
