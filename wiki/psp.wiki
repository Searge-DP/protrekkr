  The replay routine of the tracker is available for the PlayStation Portable,
  it uses the 2nd processor so the occupation time of main CPU is really minimal.

   This is an experiment and this console isn't a PC so you'd better go very easy
  on the dsp effects and channels polyphony, especially the flanger is a really heavy
  toll because the media engine doesn't have any integrated hardware sin/cos
  or pow instructions (the vfpu is only available for the main CPU).

   After a few extra measurements i noticed that the compressor (the 2 sliders right
  beside the top left vu-meters) can also heavy on the processor due to it's logarithmic
  functions and tracks polyphonies should be avoided by reducing their values
  to a minimum whenever possible.

   Samples depacking with the PSP codecs isn't implemented yet
  (so samples packing should be set to "none" in that case).
