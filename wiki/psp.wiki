  The replay routine of the tracker is available for the PlayStation Portable,
  it uses the 2nd processor so the occupation time of main CPU is really minimal.

   This is an experiment and this console isn't a PC so you'd better go very easy
  on the dsp effects and channels polyphony, especially the flanger is a really heavy
  toll because the media engine doesn't have any integrated hardware sin/cos
  or pow instructions (the vfpu is only available for the main CPU).

   Samples depacking with the PSP codecs isn't implemented yet
  (so samples packing should be set to "none" in that case).
