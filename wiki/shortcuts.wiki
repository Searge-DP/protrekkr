== Blocks ==
----

   (Blocks can also be selected with the mouse by holding the right button
   and scrolling the pattern with the mouse wheel).

   LCTRL + A:          Select entire current track
  LCTRL + LSHIFT + A: Select entire current pattern
   LALT + A:          Select entire column note in a track
   LALT + LSHIFT + A: Select all notes of a track
  LCTRL + X:          Cut the selected block and copy it into the block-buffer
  LCTRL + C:          Copy the selected block into the block-buffer
  LCTRL + V:          Paste the data from the block buffer into the pattern
  LCTRL + I:          Interpolate selected data from the first
                      to the last row of a selection

                       example:
                      (assuming only the 2 effects data columns are selected)

                       C-3  04  ..  ..  09  00 ---> C-3  04  ..  ..  09  00
                      C-3  04  ..  ..  09  00 ---> C-3  04  ..  ..  09  02
                      C-3  04  ..  ..  09  00 ---> C-3  04  ..  ..  09  05
                      C-3  04  ..  ..  09  00 ---> C-3  04  ..  ..  09  08
                      C-3  04  ..  ..  09  00 ---> C-3  04  ..  ..  09  0A
                      C-3  04  ..  ..  09  00 ---> C-3  04  ..  ..  09  0D
                      C-3  04  ..  ..  09  10 ---> C-3  04  ..  ..  09  10

                       Cool to make cutoff transitions, etc...
                      (You can also switch on the Slider Rec to On,
                      and perform parameter-live-recording, such as cutoff,
                      resonance or panning tweaking, etc..)

                       Note: this command (as well as the randomize one below)
                           only works for volume/panning and fx datas columns.

   LSHIFT + ARROWS
           PREV. PAGE
           NEXT PAGE: Select a block

   LCTRL + R:          Randomize the select columns of a selection,
                      works similar to CTRL + I, but it randomizes values
                      instead of interpolating them.

   LCTRL + U:          Transpose the note of a selection to 1 semi-note higher
  LCTRL + D:          Transpose the note of a selection to 1 semi-note lower
  LCTRL + LSHIFT + U: Transpose the note of a selection to 1 semi-note higher
                      (only for the current instrument)
  LCTRL + LSHIFT + D: Transpose the note of a selection to 1 semi-note lower
                      (only for the current instrument)
