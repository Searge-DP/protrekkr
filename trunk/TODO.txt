TODO (in no special order):

----------------------------------------------------------

[UI]
 - Create a decent gadgets system (events based).
 - Click on numbers & move the mouse to modify them (or use the wheel).
 - Alternate way to enter notes (a la fruity loops or something).
 - Use more xml scripting to completely customize the interface
   (when a decent gadgets system will be implemented, that is).
 - Graphical way to set ADSR (when the interface will be in 1024x768) or at least a gfx display of the ADSR values.
 - Drag'n'drop blocks in patterns.
 - Global synchro editor.
 - Add customization for the keys shortcuts in the xml file (may be ok like that).
 - Copy/paste functions in the samples editor.
 - Undo functions for samples editor and patterns.
 - Chords editor done with intervals (see to use a drag'n'drop system to place them on the patterns).
 - VSTs and VSTis support in the samples editor (for waveforms processing and generation).

[ENGINE]
 - Adapt codecs packers & depackers to other Operating Systems.
 - Save the synchro data as milliseconds too (+ add a Ptk_GetTime function).
 - Ability to load a new module without interrupting the currently playing one (what is it for ? djing ?).
 - Add individual panning data for instruments & synths.
 - VSTis in instruments and VSTs in tracks.
 - Envelopes scaling.
 - Possibility to associate effects to midi commands.
 - Add jackd support via libjack.
 - Possibility to select any soundcard as rendering device.

[MISC]
 - Function to wipe the current song
   (removing unused patterns, although this is done for .ptp files, it's not implemented for .ptk).
 - Import .mid files.
 - Add an audio metronome for the recording mode.
 - Add support for soundfont 2 files loading.
 - Port to FreeBSD (eventually).
 - Port to Linux PPC (eventually).
