TODO (in no special order):
----------------------------------------------------------

v2.0:

 - Complete the 303 (the env mod & accent stuff).

[UI]
 - Create a decent gadgets system (events based).
 - Click on numbers & move the mouse to modify them (or use the wheel).
 - Alternate way to enter notes (a la fruity loops or something).
   We could have 00-7f colors for the different instruments.
   Multi notes could be viewed horizontally (eg. line 01*number of notes slots) and a vertical piano roll.
   Volumes and pannings positions could be viewed as thin blocks or lines (2 pixels) (waving horizontally).
   Instruments without adsr would be viewed as small blocks.
   Effects would be viewed the same as volumes and pannings but with selected colors.
   Let the user select the colors of the instruments and effects among a palette.
   (Nothing has been determined yet).
 - Use more xml scripting to completely customize the interface
   (when a decent gadgets system will be implemented, that is).
 - Graphical way to set ADSR (when the interface will be in 1024x768) or at least a gfx display of the ADSR values.
 - Drag'n'drop blocks in patterns.
 - Global synchro editor.
 - Add customization for the keys shortcuts in the xml file (may be ok without).
 - Undo functions for samples editor and patterns.
 - Chords editor done with intervals (see to use drag'n'drop and/or double clicks to place them on the patterns).

[ENGINE]
 - Adapt codecs packers & depackers to other Operating Systems (especially OSX).
 - Save the synchro data as milliseconds too (+ add a Ptk_GetTime function).
 - Ability to load a new module without interrupting the currently playing one (djing ?).
 - Add individual panning data for instruments & synths.
 - VSTis in instruments and VSTs in tracks.
 - Envelopes scaling.
 - Possibility to associate effects to midi commands for live rec.
 - Add jackd support via libjack.
 - Possibility to select any soundcard as rendering device.
 - Tracks filters envelopes (instead of just a sin).

[MISC]
 - Function to wipe the current song
   (removing unused patterns, although this is done for .ptp files, it's not implemented for .ptk).
 - Import .mid files.
 - Add an audio metronome for the recording mode.
 - Add support for soundfont 2 files loading.
 - Port to FreeBSD (done but there's a severe issue with SDL).
 - Port to Linux PPC (should be a matter of doing the appropriate makefile, hopefully).
 - VSTs and VSTis support in the samples editor (for waveforms processing and generation).
 - Record function in the samples editor (like recording instruments played on a keyboard).
