TODO (in no special order):

----------------------------------------------------------
 - Adapt Windows dependencies (codecs packers & depackers) to other Operating Systems.
 - Create a decent gadgets system (events based).
 - Add a function to wipe the current song
   (removing unused patterns, although this is done for .ptp files, it's not implemented for .ptk).
 - Add copy/paste functions in the samples editor.
 - List of instruments (maybe switched with the scopes/files lists).
 - A global synchro editor.
 - Remove totally empty channels (nothing on every used patterns or always off).
   (and remove identical samples in .ptp).
 - Import .mid.
 - Save the synchro data as milliseconds too (+ add a Ptk_GetTime function).
 - Ability to record a selected range of patterns to WAV.
 - Add an option to play a packed sample in order to test it inside the tracker.
 - Add customization for the keys shortcuts in the xml file (may be ok like that).
 - Add a large patterns view mode (more rows).
 - Navigate through samples data with the mouse wheel in the samples editor.
 - Arrows to finetune samples looping datas in instruments tab.
 - Undo functions for samples and patterns.
 - Click on numbers & move the mouse to modify them (or use the wheel).
 - Alternate way to enter notes (a la fruity loops).
 - Ability to load a new module without interrupting the currently playing one (what is it for ? djing ?).
 - Add a set of functions to remap instruments in the sequencer tab (from -> to).
 - Use more xml scripting to completely customize the interface
   (when a decent gadgets system will be implemented, that is).
 - Graphical way to set ADSR (when the interface will be in 1024x768) or at least a gfx display of the ADSR values.
 - Add requesters (especially before overwriting files and before exiting).
 - Chords editor.
 - Add a metronome for the recording mode.
 - Add individual panning data for instruments & synths.
 - Add support for soundfont 2 files.
 - More colors in the patterns.
