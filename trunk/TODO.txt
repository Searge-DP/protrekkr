TODO:

Concerning the MacOSX port:
 - Finish to implement the sound callback.
 - Fix the loading and saving of .wav files for big endian configs.
------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Adapt Windows dependencies (midi stuff & codecs packers & depackers)
   to other Operating systems.
 - Create a decent gadgets system (events based).
 - Add a function to wipe the current song
   (removing unused patterns, although this is done for .ptp files, it's not implemented for .ptk).
 - Add copy/paste functions in the samples editor.
 - Auto-scrolling of the patterns when selecting a block with the mouse.
 - List of instruments (maybe switched with the scopes/files lists).
 - A global synchro editor.
 - Remove totally empty channels (nothing on every used patterns or always off).
   (and remove identical samples in .ptp).
 - Import .mid.
 - Also save the synchro data as milliseconds (+ add a Ptk_GetTime function).
 - Ability to record a selected range of patterns to WAV.
 - Add an option to play a packed sample in order to test it.
 - Add customization for the keys shortcuts in the xml file.
 - Add a large patterns view mode (more rows).
 - Navigate through samples data with the mouse wheel in the samples editor.
 - Arrows to finetune samples looping datas in instruments tab.
 - Undo function for samples and patterns.
 - Click on numbers & move the mouse to modify them (or use the wheel).
 - More shortcuts.
 - Small / big fonts for patterns.
 - Channels polyphony.
 - Alternate way to enter notes (a la fruity loops).
 
 - Use more xml scripting to completely customize the interface.
 - Graphical way to set ADSR (when the interface will be in 1024x768) or at least a gfx display of the ADSR values.
 - Add requesters (especially before overwriting files and before exiting).
 - Auto update (checks some web site's version file eventually).
