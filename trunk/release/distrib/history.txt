ProTrekkr releases history
===============================================================================

v1.96:

- More granularity in constants generation (potentially smaller replay).
- Mp3 samples packing bitrate is now selectable between:
  64, 88, 96, 128, 160 & 192 kbps.
- LSHIFT+I: Show instruments list / LSHIFT+S: Show synths list.
- Forgot to include LameACM.inf in the windows distribution
  (without that file the codec couldn't be installed
   and samples using mp3 packing scheme weren't packed at all, shame).
- Added At3 samples packing scheme (Windows users need to install
  the atrac3 codec located in the install directory in order to pack samples).
  Rates are: 66, 105 & 132 kbps (depacker not yet implemented on PSP, tho).
- Added the ability to select a range of positions for songs rendering to .wav.
- The nasty click occuring when loading a module while another one
  was still playing should be gone.
- Added mouse wheel navigation support in samples editor.
- Cubic interpolation can now be disabled
  (should increase speed a bit but at the expense of lower quality).

v1.95:

- Introduced small tracks
  (right click on the 3rd icon of a track or globally via the sequencer).
- Added 3 commands in the sequencer to zoom all tracks at once.
- Filesizes are now displayed beside names.
- Added an instruments remapper in the sequencer tab.

v1.94b:

- Added some colors for the notes
  (also changed the font so patterns should be a bit easier to read now).
- Added volume ramping for the 303 units.
- The 2nd 303 unit wasn't triggered correctly.

v1.94:

- Fixed a nasty memory leak in the PSP replay
  (also only necessary data are now allocated).
- Space char wasn't available during names input.
- Added effects 0x41 and 0x42 to control the volumes of the 2 303 units.
- Added effect 0x1c: set global volume.
- Start & stop song cleaned up (clicks should be gone or at least reduced).
- Fixed a small issue regarding latency in the Mac OS X version.

v1.93:

- Resampler improved, should produce much less aliasing.
- Fixed a small issue involving the cache memory in the PSP replay.

v1.92b:

- Added an option to show or hide the bottom panel in order to display
  more patterns rows (Shortcut: LSHIFT+ESCAPE to toggle the view)
- Left shift wasn't active while editing data columns
  of patterns to enter digits.

v1.92:

- Added global lists for instruments and synths,
  that should improve the ergonomy a bit.
- Samples weren't re-initiliazed correctly after a "New Module" command
  was issued.
- Fixed a bug in the 2nd oscillator of the synth core
  when using custom waveforms.

v1.91b:

- Fixed the rand commands in the synth tab.

v1.91:

- Midi controller modification command (0x90) wasn't accessible anymore
  in panning row, fixed.
- Fixed an issue that could occur with rand() function under linux.
- Introduced zoomed tracks; Each track can be zoomed independantly
  and will be displayed with a bigger font.
- Track volume wasn't correctly re-initialized when only instrument column
  was filled without any note.

v1.90e:

- Midi notes off command was broken.
- Effect 0xAxx (Set Random Cutoff) slightly modified, the xx value is now
  the amplitude of the calculated random value from 0 to 0xff.

v1.90d:

- Implemented midi in/out for Linux and Mac OS X.

v1.90c:

- Fixed a bug in the recording mode.
- Recording now starts at the current pattern line instead of restarting
  from it's beginning.

v1.90b:

- An extra note was pasted after names input when editing mode was turned on.

v1.90:

- Added a scrollbar beside patterns.
- The tracker can now load all these .wav file formats (mono or stereo) :
  - 8-bit integer.
  - 12-bit integer.
  - 16-bit integer.
  - 24-bit integer.
  - 32-bit integer.
  - 32-bit float.
  - 64-bit float.
- Added an option to render a module as 32 bit (float) .wav file.
- Inverted the right and left mouse buttons functions in patterns.
- Fixed an issue with the loop editor.
- Patterns now automatically scroll when using the right mouse button
  (also work when selecting a block).
- Added multi notes channels, they can be used to trigger several notes / track
  at the same time in order to make chords or to play several instruments
  in the same track and route them to the same row effect / dsp effect
  (thus allowing to considerably reduce the dsp usage and also introduce some
   modularity which could be useful, especially for the PSP replay).
  Note that these channels are shared with the polyphony ones.
- Improved volume ramping.
- Keys repeat was disabled when editing note columns.
- Added LCTRL+TAB and LCTRL+LSHIFT+TAB to cycle through the notes of a track.
- Added LALT+A and LALT+LSHIFT+A
  to select one or all notes/instruments columns of a track.
- Modified the record function (for a better one, i hope).
- Some edition commands weren't working on last track.
- Midi channels polyphony implemented.
- Improved Mac OS X keyboard handling a bit.
- Compressor wasn't set right when loading .ptp files.

v1.86b:

- Fixed a bug with the 303 data loading in the replay routine.
- Fx 0A (Set random cutoff) was disabled due to a typo in the fx constants.
- Added the first version of a replay routine for the PSP,
  
  It uses the 2nd processor so the main CPU time occupation is really minimal.
  
  Keep in mind that this is an experiment and that this console isn't a PC
  so you'd better go very easy on the dsp effects and channels polyphony,
  especially the flanger is a really heavy toll because the media engine
  doesn't have any integrated hardware sin/cos or pow instructions.

  Samples depacking with the PSP codecs isn't implemented yet
  (so samples packing should be set to "none" in that case).

v1.86:

- Fixed a bug with channels that could be heard faintly even when being muted
  (was also present in wav rendering).
- Channels polyphony (up to 16) implemented.
  Value for a module can be changed in FX Setup tab.
- Switching to FX Setup tab produced a small sound glitch
  due to a re-generation of the reverb buffers.
- Added C-masters.ptk by Rhino.
- Keyboard polyphony improved (notes don't "spread" on other tracks).
- Removed some clicks due to channels filters.
- Fixed a bug in .ptk depacking process which could lead to a crash.

v1.85c:

- Removed the Audio unit code from the Mac OS X port and went to device level,

  (no midi and no samples compression).
- Fixed a bug in the replay which would sometimes lead to a crash
  if an instrument number was used without a note.
- Renamed .psy file to .psm.
- The tracker is now using a custom mouse pointer.
- Forgot to mention it but the manual is now only available at this url:
  http://code.google.com/p/protrekkr/wiki/introduction

v1.84b:

- Added dream weaver.ptk from Rhino.
- Fixed a bug which occured when loading presets files,
  portamento glide was turned to 50% if it was off.
- Divided the output level of the stock waveforms by 2.

  *may* have been solved.

v1.83c:

- Added Arpeggio effect (1B):
  It's behaviour is a bit different than from other trackers, example:
  
  C-7 00 .. .. 1B37 <- Turn it on
  --- .. .. .. 0000
  --- .. .. .. 0000
  --- .. .. .. 0000
  --- .. .. .. 1B38 <- Change datas
  --- .. .. .. 0000
  --- .. .. .. 0000
  --- .. .. .. 0000
  --- .. .. .. 1B00 <- Turn it off
  
  (Note that effects 01, 02 & 05 are ineffective when 1B is turned on).

  a .psy file containing synchro informations is now created
  whenever a .ptp module is saved (if the effect 7 isn't used in a module
  such file won't be created at all).
  Check manual.txt for .psy files structure.

  (Thanks to kaneel for notifying me about that one)
- LCTRL + LSHIFT + U/D: Transpose the note of a selected block
                        to 1 seminote higher/lower but only for the currently

- Fixed a bug in the 303 patterns handling.

v1.0d:

  (proportional to the length of the loop but independant of the note)
  that should help creating short custom synthetic like samples.

v1.0c:

- Fixed a bug in ADSR release for waveforms.

v1.0b:

- Fixed a small bug with channels on/off status in the replay.
- Fixed a bug when using the mouse wheel on the sequencer.

- Shift+Arrows/Page up/down: select block.

Beta b:

- Fixed a bug with the lengths of the waveforms ADSR handling.
- Setting a loop of length 0 in the sample ed. will just disable
  the looping mode for that instrument
  (and avoid the tracker to crash when trying to replay it).
